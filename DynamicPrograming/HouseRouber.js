// Find maximum possible stolen value from houses
// There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. 
// A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal 
// in two adjacent houses because owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbour 
// left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value.

// Examples:

// Input  : hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
// Output : 19
// Thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from house.

// Input  : hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
// Output : 16
// Thief will steal 5 and 11
