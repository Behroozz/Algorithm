// Solving this problem takes an iterative approach of: 

//1) Expected Size of the System
//2) Expected tolerable response time
//3) High Level Design
//    1) the logic, which will handle all incoming requests to the application and 
//    2) the data storage that we will use to store all the data that needs to be persisted.
//4) Define operations

// Example:
// posting new tweets (Write)
// following a user (Write)
// favoriting a tweet (Write)
// displaying data about users and tweets (React)

// 5) Come up wth UI
// 6) Create Database
// 7) Create Rest API (Pagination, Authorization, Error Handling)
// 8) Load Test
// 9) Profile Bootleneck
// 10) Address bottle next and Repeat
